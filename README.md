# EdenStaffApp-BOT
This telegram bot was meant to replace the Staff Application section of the EdenMine forum while it was unavailable to the public due to maintenance issues. 

## ‚ú® Features
- MySQL Based (to save the users' IDs)
- Management Panel (Staff && Admin)

## ‚ùî How to install
You have to recompile all the source-code and edit the code as you wish (since there's no configuration file, it's all hard-coded). No dependencies are needed.
As I wrote before a MySQL database is needed to run the bot.

## üìö Usage
### STAFF SECTION
#### Staff Management Panel
This panel is used to manage who's able to receive and see the staff application that are being sent by the users through the bot.

#### Admin Management Panel
This panel is used to manage who can edit the staff list. In this case I hard-coded the ID of the actual co-owner of the network, to let him be the only person who has the permission to see this section, but if you want to edit it you're free to do so.

### USER SECTION
The normal users will be stored onto the database, and they'll be able to send the staff application through a telegra.ph link.

## P.S
This bot won't be updated, so if you want to edit it you must do it by yourself.
